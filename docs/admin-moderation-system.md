## Technical Implementation

### Middleware
- `src/lib/admin.ts` - Admin authorization utilities
- `requireAdmin()` - Server-side admin protection
- `isAdmin()` - Client-side admin checks

### Database Queries
- Filtered queries exclude deleted content for regular users
- Admin queries can include deleted content with `showDeleted` parameter
- Efficient pagination with proper indexing

### State Management
- React hooks for data fetching and state management
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## Deployment Considerations

### Database Migration
Run the admin moderation migration:
```bash
bunx prisma db push
```

### Environment Variables
Ensure proper NextAuth configuration for admin role detection.

### Performance
- Database indexes on `isDeleted`, `role`, and timestamp fields
- Pagination to handle large datasets
- Efficient queries with proper includes and selects

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Bulk moderation actions
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- Email notifications for moderation actions
- Detailed audit logs and reporting
- Content flagging system
- Automated moderation rules

### Analytics Improvements
- User engagement metrics
- Content performance analytics
- Moderation activity reports
- Platform health monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Admin access denied**: Verify user role is set to "ADMIN" in database
2. **Deleted content still visible**: Check if queries include `isDeleted: false` filter
3. **Permission errors**: Ensure proper session validation in API routes

### Debug Steps
1. Check user role in database
2. Verify session data in browser dev tools
3. Check server logs for authentication errors
4. Validate API endpoint responses
